This project demonstrates an interactive character animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can select different animation states from a dropdown menu, and the chosen animation will be displayed on the canvas. The animations are based on a sprite sheet, which includes frames for various actions such as running, jumping, and idle.

## Features

<ul>
  <li><strong>Interactive Interface</strong>: Users can switch between different animation states using a dropdown menu.</li>
  <li><strong>Smooth Animations</strong>: The animations are rendered smoothly using the HTML5 canvas and JavaScript's <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> method.</li>
  <li><strong>Modular Design</strong>: The project is organized into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for better maintainability.</li>
</ul>

## Technologies Used
